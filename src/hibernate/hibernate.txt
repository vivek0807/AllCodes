    hibernate.dialect
  <property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class" >jdbc class name</property>
    hibernate.connecton.url=url of the database
    hibernate.connecton.username=username of the database
    hbm2ddl.auto = auto validation

  hibernate
  configuration-reads all properties
  session factory-connection establisher
  Session-physical connection, query executer

  ======================================================
            MAPPING
types:
@one2one (cascade- attribute is mandatory while apllying attributes,trsnsfers operations done one to one,
            Cascade  from parent to child, All, None) deleting parent also deletes child

@one to many (bi-directional) relationship
many2many (fetch how to get the child object,Lazy/Eager)
many2one mappedby
-Fetch attribuite decides how to retrive data(Lazy/Eager)
-class must have embeddable annotation for composite key
-class must implement serializable inteface
-it must have a defauly constructor
-it must have a primary key of its own

MappedBy-used in hibernate to tell which variable we are representing the parent class
==================================================
Spring MVC with hibernate

-spring basically used for developing web application using java
