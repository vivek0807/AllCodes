-invented by james goosling
-platform independent
-portable
-architecture neutral
-JVM translates the java code to native code that a machine will understand[JVM IS PLATFORM DEPENDENT]
-JRE consists of teh JVM and libraries and core classes
-java compiler-javac
-java documenter- javadoc
-java archiver -jar


-development Env
-Execution Env-JDK depends on OS
				-byte code converter as the .class file that execute on JVM
				-the JRE further translates to native language
				
-Editions Of java
	Standard- J2SE	OR JSE
	Enterprise -J2EE- tools to develop standlone apps & servelets
	Micro Edition- J2ME- for mobile applications and hand held devices
	
=====================
DATA TYPES & OPERATORS
identifiers are names given to class,variables and methods
$name,_name
-objects memory are allocated in heap

Types of conversion- 
	IMPLICIT CONVERSION--when lower size data type assigned to higher size data type conversion is done automaticllay
	EXPLICIT CONVERSION--Typecasting, to lower sized data type
	
	-If there are two operators of equal priority, then exression is evaluated as per associativity
	-only for conditional operator associativity folow right to left
===============


CONTROL STRUCTURES	

===============
Static methods
-static member can access stativ variables only
-non static can access both kind of members
- static block can used to run a direct code before main
===============
Wrapper class
there are 8 wrapper classes that bind the primitive data type to reference 
-All the wrapper class has inbuilt methods that help in certain operations
-Inter i=new Integer(0);
-for value= int j=i.intValue();
-Integer i=10; Boxing
int j=i Unboxing;
-wrapper classes are contained in java.lang package
Available since java 5
** not for every primitive dataType there is a wrapper class
===================
Packages
-They provide access restriction
-can contain classes subpackages interfaces
-They must be the first statement in code else Lead to COMPILE TIME JAVA.
classpath can be set as--%classpath%<location of the .class file>
- FOR ANY STATIC method or value to be imported as static, IT MUST BE DECLARED AS PUBLIC STATIC
-For any method to be called from another package it MUST BE DECLARED AS STATIC
 methods can also be called as new X().display(100);
